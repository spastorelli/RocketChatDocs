## Project Ideas

This list is being updated regularly, some project ideas are still subject to further refinement, and some projects without assigned mentors may be removed.

### Guided RC Code Walkthrough and Tutorial

**Mentor(s):** Kevin Aleman

**Description:**\
Most Rocket.Chat developers uses VSCode when studying our massive production code base, and when writing new code. VSCode is the best environment for conducting interactive tutorial and code walkthroughs. The CodeTour extension available in VSCode can be used to create such walkthrough and tutorials. This project involves the development of a set of guided tutorials using CodeTour that will help new developers to understand how to perform multiple actions. Paths to be documented will go from this areas:

* How a message is sent
* How to create an endpoint
* How to add a new service
* How to create a DB model
* How to use DB models
* How services interact between them
* How to build a lib
* How to navigate monorepo (where is everything, how's imported, etc)

We welcome any additional ideas you may have.

**Desired Skills:** JNodeJS, MongoDB

**Goals/Deliverables:** A set of guided tours from the topics described above

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)

**Difficulty:** Easy/Medium\\

### Moderation Console Mute User Action and Emoji Votes

**Mentors:** Devanshu Sharma

\*\*\*\*Moderation console for Rocket.Chat enables moderators to examine reported messages and then take action against the individuals who post them. A simple set of action is already included. In this project you will add the action to allow muting of the user for a specific duration.

Currently, the only way to submit messages for moderator's review is to report the message. This project will add a mini-reputation system, through voting with special emojis, to assist the moderator in deciding what to do with the reported user. A count of special emojis against a message can be used to determine the number of users that find a particular message offensive.

**Desired Skills:**\
\*\*\*\*ReactJS, TypeScript, MeteorJS. A thorough understanding of Moderation Console operations. Knowledge of how to expose additional core features to Apps.

**Goals/Deliverables:**\

### GitHub Pull request reminders app

**Mentors:** Murtaza Patrawala, Samad Khan

**Description:**\
Have you ever faced challenges keeping track of your pull request reviews as a student? This is a common problem faced by many development teams. That's why we propose developing a pull request reminder app for [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) as a part of the Google Summer of Code program. For now, weâ€™re isolating the scope of this project to GitHub.

The app's goal will be to provide regular reminders and updates to keep the review process moving and help ensure that pull requests are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner. This project will be built on top of [this existing GitHub App](https://github.com/RocketChat/Apps.Github22) which already has a bunch of boilerplate code to deal with authentications and GitHub APIs.

One approach to solving the issue of pending pull requests is to create a separate Rocket.Chat channels for each pull request (This is a proven strategy organizations already use on Slack. Check [here](https://axolo.co/blog/p/utlimate-slack-pull-request-reminder-bot) for more info). This way, all relevant stakeholders can be added to the channel, including the author of the pull request, the reviewers, and any other team members who need to be informed about the status of the review.

The Rocket.Chat channels can serve as a dedicated space for discussion and collaboration around each pull request. Users can receive notifications about updates to the pull request, such as new comments or changes to the code. This helps keep everyone informed and ensures the review process stays on track.

Example text message for Rocket.Chat channel:

* "ðŸ”” Attention reviewers! This pull request has been pending for \[number] days now. Let's make sure to give it the attention it deserves and keep the review process moving forward ðŸš€"

In addition, the users can also opt-in to receive a direct message from the bot at the start of their workday, with a comprehensive list of all the reviews that need his/her attention.

Example DM text messages:

1. "ðŸ‘€ Time to give those pull requests some love! You've got \[number] pending review(s) waiting for you. Don't keep your fellow developers waiting ðŸ˜Š"
2. "ðŸ”” Don't let those pull requests get forgotten! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Let's get to work ðŸ’»"
3. "ðŸš€ It's time to move those pull requests forward! You've got \[number] waiting for your review. Give them the green light ðŸ’š"

By using Rocket.Chat channels to manage the review process, teams can improve the visibility of their pull requests and ensure that they are being reviewed and discussed in a timely manner.

PS: For more inspiration on how to solve this issue, please refer to some of these solutions on other platforms.

### Open source Metaverse integration (mozilla hubs / third room)

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
\*\*\*\*One very popular interpretation of the "Metaverse" is group interactions within a real-time rendered 3D Virtual Reality world. [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) has been the leading open source project in this space for the **last decade**. Due to the limitation (and cost) of today's technology, however, hub has always had limited scalability. Rooms can contain 20 to 30 attendees. Another similar technology proof of concept has emerged recently in [Third Room](https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom). While Rocket.Chat as a collaboration platform has re-architectured to handle millions of users - and through federation, the world; we have also implemented Team Channels to deal with very large communities wanting autonomous control over their membership. This project is to create a rational integration between Mozilla Hubs (and/or Third Room) and Rocket.Chat team channel - enabling a pragmatic version of "the metaverse" to be built organically.\
\
We welcome original proposals at different levels of integration. It can be a direct extension of core, an external bridge, a link preview-extension, or even a Rocket.Chat App.\


**Desired Skills:**

ReactJS, TypeScript, MeteorJS. A thorough understanding of how Rocket.Chat core works. Knowledge of Rocket.Chat Apps development. Passion for improving human communications and collaboration.

**Goals/Deliverables:**\
\*\*\*\*Working integration of Mozilla Hubs rooms within Rocket.Chat Team Channels in a rational and usable context.

**Project Duration:** 350 hours (Large)\
\
**Difficulty:** Advanced\\

### Jitsi Meet x Rocket.Chat

**Mentors:** TBD\
\
**Description:**\
\*\*\*\*Jitsi meet has become one of the most popular and frequently used open source video conference platform in the world. The chat that is included as part of the Jitsi system is rudimentary and chat history is lost as soon as the conference is over. This project leverages our existing _**EmbeddedChat**_ project to integrate an embedded version of Rocket.Chat into Jitsi Meet - giving it a rich messaging experience with full history after conference.\
\
Ideally we would like an integration at the [Jitsi Meet React SDK](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-react-sdk/) level. Perhaps extending the _\<JitsiMeeting/>_ tag with a _useRCForChat_ attribute. The integration should maintain prosody as the single source of truth for channel membership. A variety of server authentication scenarios must be catered for (including SSO and Oauth).

**Desired Skills:** React Native, in-depth knowledge of EmbeddedChat project, familiarity with Jitsi Meet, understanding of prodigy.\
\*\*\*\*\
**Goal/Deliverable:** Jitsi Meet with Rocket.Chat embedded in place of existing chat.\

**Difficulty:** Medium/Advanced\\

### QuickAnswer Bot

**Mentors:** Debdut Chakraborty

**Description:**\
\*\*\*\*The goal is to develop a bot that can help reduce repetitive questions asked in Rocket.Chat channels by providing relevant answers from its knowledge base (Similar to [this Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/ASAFS8C2D-truffle?tab=more\_info))

Features:

1. Knowledge base: The bot will have a knowledge base of all previously answered questions and their answers.
2. Real-time scanning: The bot will scan the Rocket.Chat channels in real-time for new questions and check if it has a relevant answer in its knowledge base.
3. Private response: If the bot finds a relevant answer, it will send the answer privately to the person who asked the question, without interrupting the public conversation.
4. Analytics (optional): The bot will keep track of the number of repetitive questions answered and provide analytics to the administrator.

Technologies to be used:

* [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) apps-engine
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Elasticsearch (a suggestion, but Iâ€™m open to any other good alternatives)

With Elasticsearch integrated into the tech stack, the bot can leverage the powerful search and analysis capabilities of Elasticsearch to efficiently search through the knowledge base and provide accurate answers to the user's questions. [Hereâ€™s](https://rebeccabilbro.github.io/intro-doc-similarity-with-elasticsearch/) a good blog to get started.

**Desirable Skills:** Advanced knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP); [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) apps-engine; Experience using chosen indexing framework like ElasticSearch

**Difficulty:** Medium/Advanced

### Full-stack Components Framework for Community Builders

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
\*\*\*\*Full-stack component is the holy grail of software componentization. Imagine building a fully functional customized web portal in minutes by dragging and dropping full-stack components. Each component not only contains interactive UI, but also associated mid-tier and server-side/severless behaviours as well as parameterizations. Unfortunately the state of our current software art is not quite there yet. The next best thing is actually [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) which solves the same problem but at a page level and not at the component-within-the-page level.\
\
RC4Community is a specialized componentized framework for community builders to rapidly create fully functional community portal. It was designed to work with a full-stack component framework since day one - but had to use Next.js instead.

This project involves the introduction of the missing architectural, build workflow, and packaging technology to enable full-stack components within the RC4Community context.

**Desirable Skills:** ReactJS, JavaScript, Next.js, server-side technology, serverless technology, microservices. A thorough understanding of how current component framework works. In-depth understanding of modern devops technology. In-depth understanding of JavaScript packaging technology and workflow. A passion for pushing the limits of modern componentized software development tools.

**Goal/Deliverable:** A set of full stack components for community builders. A framework that allows new components to be hosted on their own independent repositories and be packaged into modules that can be installed over the network as needed (similar to npm model today).

**Project Duration:** 350 hours. (Large)\
\
**Difficulty:** Advanced\
\\

### Token Economy for Team Channels

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
Rocket.Chat has Team Channels to handle sub-communities wanting autonomous control over their membership within a scaled server (possibly servicing tens of thousands of users).

This project aims to provide such sub-communities / teams with a mean to:

* mint their own erc-20 token, unique to the team
* distribute the tokens to the members of the team
* enable tokens to be securely exchanged between members within the team channels

The implementation can also work optionally with blockchains and tokens from other providers - but this is not mandatory. Integration with a wallet is implied but novel alternative solution will also be accepted. It can be implemented as a Rocket.Chat App or extension to core, or both.

**Desirable Skills:** Thorough understanding of Rocket.Chat core. Working experience with modern Web3 / blockchain technologies. Rocket.Chat App development experience. Advanced Typescript

**Goal/Deliverable:** Ability to mint, distribute, and exchange unique erc-20 tokend within a "team".

**Difficulty:** Medium/Advanced

### Template messages Rocket.Chat app

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:**\
This project aims to develop a [Rocket.Chat](http://rocket.chat) app that allows users to create, store, and send common messages with ease (Similar to [this Slack app](https://slack.com/apps/AJGJWCYPQ-templates?tab=more\_info)). The app will have a simple interface that enables users to create templates with customized names. These templates can be triggered using a slash command (e.g., /template \<template-name>) and inserted into the chat window with just one click. Users can also edit and delete their templates as needed.

The app will be built using [the Apps-Engine framework](https://developer.rocket.chat/apps-engine/rocket.chat-apps-engine) as a Rocket.Chat app. This app will improve productivity and streamline communication in Rocket.Chat, provides a convenient way for users to send common messages and save time in their daily work routine.

Examples of use cases include a customer support agent responding to frequently asked questions, a project manager sending a weekly status update message to the team, or a sales representative following up with potential clients.

**Desirable Skills:** Rocket.Chat app-engine Framework. Rocket.Chat UiKit. Advanced Typescript

**Goal/Deliverable:** A working Rocket.Chat app to send and manage template messages.

**Project Duration:** 175 hours. (Medium)\

### User Actions Audit Center

**Mentors:** TBD

**Description:** The goal of this project is to make a service (Back end) capable of tracking user actions (role change, permission change, setting change, critical endpoint calls, etc) and then list them to admins. This will serve as a way of auditability of actions, reducing support friction (since this will make changes to system easier to track) and improve quality. Ideally, an Admin section will be shown with the list of actions, which would be filtered by type/user/level. Setting should also be in place to see if actions should be tracked or not and which actions to track

**Desirable Skills:** Advanced Typescript and mid level React

**Goal/Deliverable:** A working User Actions Audit Service.

### Big Blue Button x Rocket.Chat
