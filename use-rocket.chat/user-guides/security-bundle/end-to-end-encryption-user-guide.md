# End to End Encryption User Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
**IMPORTANT:** **E2E encryption functionality is currently in beta** and includes notable restrictions that workspace owners should carefully consider before activating this feature for production use as follow:

* E2E encrypted messages will not appear in search operations
* Bots or other ancillary systems interacting via webhooks or REST API will not be able to read E2EE encrypted messages
* File uploads are not encrypted
* Rocket.Chat enables users to reset their private E2EE key to avoid permanent loss of data during the beta period
{% endhint %}

## Getting started

To be able to use E2E Encryption, your Rocket.Chat workspace administrator must turn on the End to End Encryption feature.

{% content-ref url="../../workspace-administration/settings/e2e-encryption.md" %}
[e2e-encryption.md](../../workspace-administration/settings/e2e-encryption.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="success" %}
With E2E enabled, users can create encrypted rooms and send encrypted messages.
{% endhint %}
