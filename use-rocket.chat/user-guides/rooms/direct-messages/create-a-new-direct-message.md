# Create a new Direct Message

## Create a new Direct Message (1:1)

You can start a 1:1 DM with another user from any room in your workspace when you open their profile and click the **Direct Message** button. You can also create a DM from the menu bar.

### Create a Direct Message from Menu Bar

To create a direct message from the menu bar,

* On the Rocket.Chat menu bar, click the **Create New** icon, then select **Direct Message**.
* Select the user you want to start a DM with. Then, click **Create.**
* A new direct message is opened with the user, and you can now communicate privately.

### Creating a Direct Message from a Room

You can open a 1:1 **DM** with a user if you are in the same room as them by following these steps:

* Click the **Members** icon at the top-right menu of the room screen. At first, the list only shows currently active users. Select **All** from the dropdown option beside the search bar to see all users.
* Select the user you want to start a **DM** with. Click on the **Direct Message** button below their avatar, and a direct message is opened for you and that user.

## Create a new multi-user Direct Message (1:M)

To create a 1:M direct message,

* On the Rocket.Chat menu bar, click the **Create New** icon, then select **Direct Message**.
* Select the users you want to start a DM with. Then, click **Create.**
* A new direct message is opened with the users, and you can now communicate with all of them in a DM.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can not ignore, block, mute, or remove a user for multi-user DMs. Although, you can start a call or start a 1:1 DM with them.
{% endhint %}

Here are some important features to note about a multi-user DM:

* You can't create a multi-user DM with the same user combination.
* Once a DM is created, the membership can't be updated. So, you can't add or remove members to the DM.
* No one is the owner, unlike [channels](../channels/).
* The DM can not be deleted. You can only hide the conversation.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend a maximum of 8 users in a DM. However, contact your workspace administrator if you need to update it to suit your needs.
{% endhint %}

## Mark Direct Message as Favorite

All DMs marked as favorites are listed at the top of the sidebar so that it is easy to access.

To mark a **DM** as favorite,

* At the top of the DM screen, click the **star** icon next to the DM header to mark it as **Favorite**.
* To remove the DM from **Favorites,** click the **star** icon again.
