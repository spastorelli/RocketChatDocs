# Channel LiveStream

The Streaming tab is displayed on the Channel **Options** menu if the [Youtube Livestream](../../../workspace-administration/settings/livestream-and-broadcasting.md) feature is enabled. Channel owners and workspace administrators can start streaming or add another stream to the channel by specifying a URL through the **Streaming** tab.

You might only be able to link live broadcasts from YouTube, depending on the workspace settings. When in doubt, always ask the server administrator.
{% endhint %}

## Start Streaming

To start a stream,

* Click **Livestream** from the **Options** menu.
* Add the **Livestream Source URL**.

{% endhint %}

* To add a different Livestream, get the URL for the stream, enter it into the **Livestream source** field, and hit save.
