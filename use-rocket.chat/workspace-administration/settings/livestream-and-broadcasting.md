{% endhint %}

## Configuration

The integration between Rocket and YouTube Live allows channel owners to broadcast their live camera feed to Livestream inside a channel. You can only use the Broadcasting feature with the Livestream feature.

Users can not create live broadcasts using their webcams if you switch the **Broadcasting Enable** to **false** in your broadcast settings, but they can still link to a live stream from YouTube.

To use YouTube Live integration, the workspace administrator needs a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount) to access the [Google API Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). With this, the administrator has access to a valid Client ID, API Key, and Secret, which is essential for broadcasting.

## Livestream

After a correct set-up, the Livestream tab allows you to Broadcast your camera when editing the source URL. While we prepare the broadcast and live stream for your session, opening the popout can take a little while. A blinking icon and "**Preparing**" status displays in the control bar. After that initial phase, the broadcast will be ready and available to start with your click.
