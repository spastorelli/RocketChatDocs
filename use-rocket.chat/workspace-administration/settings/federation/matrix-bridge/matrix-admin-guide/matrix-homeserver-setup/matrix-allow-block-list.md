# Matrix Allow/Block List

### Synapse

To create allow/block lists on the Synapse installation you need to change it directly in the configuration file (homeserver.yaml), blocking undesired communication with specific homeservers or allowing only the desired ones.

#### Block List

Add the following to the Synapse configuration file:

`ip_range_blacklist`: Creates a block list by IP ranges. (List all IPs you want as a YAML array.)

[More Info](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/upgrade.html#blacklisting-ip-ranges)

#### Allow List

Add the following to the Synapse configuration file:

`ip_range_whitelist`: Creates an allow list by IP ranges. (List all IPs you want as a YAML array.)

`federation_domain_whitelist`: Creates an allow list by domain names. (List all domain names you want as a YAML array.)

After creating the desired configuration, restart the Synapse server and everything you specified should be blocked.

### Dendrite

Dendrite does not support creating allow/block lists at this point yet.
