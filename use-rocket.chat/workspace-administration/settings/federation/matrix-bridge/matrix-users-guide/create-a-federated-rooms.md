## Creating a channel/group (Enterprise edition only)

You can create federated [Channels](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/channels/) having both Rocket.Chat and other federated users.

To create a federated channel,

* Start by [creating a channel](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/channels/create-a-new-channel.md) within your Rocket.Chat workspace
* Enable **Federated**
* **Add members** if any or keep empty
* **Create**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important**:

* Federated Channels can not be _Encrypted, Read-Only, or Broadcasted_ for now\_.\_
* You cannot create [Threads](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/threads/) or [Discussions](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/discussions/) within federated Channels.
{% endhint %}

Whenever your user is invited to participate in a federated room, if that room was created in an external server, you will be able to see from which server (server name) the room is originally from. This helps the user to differentiate when there are multiple rooms with the same name, but all from different servers.

## Creating a Direct Message 1:1 (Enterprise edition only)

You can create a [Direct Message](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/) with other federated users.

Create a federated DM with these steps:

* Start- by [creating a 1:1 Direct Message](../../../../../user-guides/rooms/direct-messages/create-a-new-direct-message.md)
* Set the federated user you wish to message following the [syntax to invite external users](invite-external-users-to-your-rocket.chat-server.md#invite-external-users-syntax).

## Creating a Multi-user Direct Message

Using [Multi Direct Message](https://github.com/spastorelli/RocketChatDocs/blob/test-datasync-changes/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/federation/matrix-bridge/matrix-users-guide/broken-reference/README.md), you can send Direct Messages to multiple users(federated or not) at once.

To create a federated Multi Direct Message:

* [Create a Multi-user Direct Message](https://github.com/spastorelli/RocketChatDocs/blob/test-datasync-changes/use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/federation/matrix-bridge/matrix-users-guide/broken-reference/README.md)
* Select users, you want to send messages to following the [syntax to invite external users](invite-external-users-to-your-rocket.chat-server.md#invite-external-users-syntax).

## Slash commands

You can also use an available slash command to create and invite users for Direct Messages rooms. The general syntax for the available slash command is:

```
/federation dm @username:server.com
```

Where:

* `/federation`: The slash command itself.
* `dm`: The command you want to execute, _dm_ is the only one available at this point.
* `@username:server.com`: The external user you want to invite, using the [syntax to invite external users.](invite-external-users-to-your-rocket.chat-server.md#invite-external-users-syntax)
