# View Logs

In the **View Logs** section of your Rocket.Chat server, you can see all the information configured to be logged. This can help you troubleshoot or monitor the state of your server's activity.

Check out the [Logs Settings](settings/logs.md) for additional configurations on what to log.

To access this menu, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **View Log**
