As a Live Chat Manager, you can set Tags to be assigned to the Live Chat conversations by the agents. Tags can be used to sort Live Chat conversations easily. **Omnichannel Tags** are used for marking and classifying Omnichannel conversations.

{% hint style="info" %}
A practical use case is using tags to mark the progress made on a Live Chat query. You can have tags like `new`, `blocked`, `in progress,` `completed` etc.
{% endhint %}

To access **Tags** settings,

* Go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Tags**.

## List Omnichannel Tags

On the Tags menu, you see a list of tags if they exist. Clicking on one opens up a page where it can be edited.

## Create Omnichannel Tags

To create a new Tag:

* Click on **+ New**
* Update the required information and click **Save**
  * **Name**: Enter the name you wish for the Tag
  * **Description**: A description of what the Tag is
  * **Departments**: This lets you select a list of departments in which the Tag is available. Leave it empty to set it available to all departments.

When created, [Omnichannel Agents](agents.md) can use the Tag on conversations.

## Delete Omnichannel Tags

To delete an existing **Tag**,

* Click on the **Delete icon** across the **Tag** from the main settings screen.
