Monitors in Omnichannel are users that have the ability to monitor Omnichannel activities and have access to [Current Chats](current-chats.md), [Analytics](analytics.md), [Real-time Monitoring](real-time-monitoring.md), [Agents](agents.md), [Departments](departments.md), [Business Hours](business-hours-managers-guide.md) and [Canned Responses](canned-responses/).

{% hint style="info" %}
A monitor is only able to view analytics or activities of a department if they are assigned to a [unit](units-managers-guide.md).
{% endhint %}

To access Omnichannel Monitors,

* Go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Monitors**.

## List Omnichannel Monitors

On the Monitors page, a list of all the users with `livechat-monitor` role is displayed. From here, you can [add new monitors](monitors-managers-guide.md#2.-add-new-omnichannel-monitor) or [delete existing monitors](monitors-managers-guide.md#3.-delete-omnichannel-monitor).

## Add New Omnichannel Monitor

To add a new monitor(s),

* Enter the person's username in the username field and hit the **Add** button. This will automatically assign that user the `livechat-monitor` role.

## Delete Omnichannel Monitor

To delete an Omnichannel Monitor,

* Click the **Delete icon** on the right across the user. This will remove the `livechat-monitor` role from that user.
