# Agents

Omnichannel **Agents** are responsible for handling Omnichannel conversations. An agent can belong to a particular department and gets notified when a new conversation gets initiated if they are **available**.

To access this menu, go to **Administration > Omnichannel > Agents**. Here, you can **view**, **add** or **remove** agents.

## **Add Omnichannel Agent**

To add a user as an Omnichannel agent,

* Search or select the user from the **username field**.
* **Click Add**.

This will automatically assign the **Omnichannel Agent** role to that user.

## **View Omnichannel Agent**

On the Omnichannel Agent menu, a list of all the existing agents is available with their details and can be paginated if you have many agents. An agent's status can be seen on the **Live Chat Status** tab showing whether they are available or not.

Click an agent to edit their agent details.
