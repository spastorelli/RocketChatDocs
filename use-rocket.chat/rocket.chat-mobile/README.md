## Exploring your workspace's homepage

Rocket.Chat's homepage has a **navigation drawer menu**, **toolbar,** and **main body,** allowing you to perform different actions.

### Navigation Drawer

The navigation drawer menu carries your profile avatar, name, and workspace name at the top and five action items which are Edit Status, Chats, Profile, Display, and Settings.

* **The Edit Status** item is used to set a [custom status](../workspace-administration/user-status.md).
* **The Chats item** reveals the rooms you are part of, enabling you to select any and start a conversation.
* **The Profile** takes you to the screen for managing your [profile](../rocket.chat-cloud/manage-your-cloud-account/profile.md).
* **The Display** item takes you to the screen for display settings for you to choose between expanded or condensed messages, the sort order, and the grouping order of your rooms.
* **The settings item** takes you to the screen for app settings such as language, default browser, theme, and more.

### Toolbar

The toolbar (action bar) has three action icons.

* The <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/create icon (1).png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon is used to create [Rooms](../user-guides/rooms/).
* The <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/search icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon searches your whole workspace, from rooms to users and messages.
* The <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/hashtag icon.png" alt="" data-size="line"> icon is used to search for rooms that you are already part of or the ones which you might want to join.
