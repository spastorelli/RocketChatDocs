Rocket.Chat allows authorized users to audit messages and read conversations in a workspace. The user must have an `auditor` [role](https://github.com/spastorelli/RocketChatDocs/blob/test-datasync-changes/setup-and-administer-rocket.chat/roles-in-rocket.chat) and `Can Audit` [permission](../workspace-administration/permissions.md) to access the auditing panel. As an organization, you may want to inspect the [omnichannel](../omnichannel/) conversations and watch out for [agents ](../omnichannel/agents.md)that use improper language with customers. An auditor can do the following:

* Review messages in private rooms.
* Review messages by users.
* Review direct messages between users.
* Review omnichannel messages.
* Check the audit history of individuals using the Message Auditing Panel.

To access the Message Auditing Panel,

* Navigate to **Administration** > **Audit** > **Messages,**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you cant find the audit options, don't hesitate to get in touch with your workspace administrator to [assign message auditing permmisions to you](assign-message-auditing-permissions-to-specific-users.md).

See [**Messaging Auditing Log**](./) to learn more about the auditing log history.
