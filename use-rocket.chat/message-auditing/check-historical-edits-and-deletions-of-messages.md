# Check Historical Edits and Deletions of Messages

Rocket.Chat lets you view any message history, including modified or removed messages.

To update message history settings,

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Message.**
* Enable **Allow Message Editing** and **Keep Per Message Editing History** to see a history of all messages and not only the last edit made.
* Disable **Allow Message Deleting**. Otherwise, messages show only the _deleted_ status, and you cannot see the complete message history.
