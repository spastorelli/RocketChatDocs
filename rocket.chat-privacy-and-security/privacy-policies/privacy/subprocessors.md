We have updated this policy. For the previous version of this policy, please expand the section [below](subprocessors.md#previous-versions-of-this-subprocessors-list).

The list below identifies sub-contractors (sub-processors) that may be engaged by Rocket.Chat to Process personal data during the provisioning of our Services.
