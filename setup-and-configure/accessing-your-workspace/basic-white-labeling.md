# Basic White-labeling

Leverage the white-labelling capabilities of Rocket.Chat to give your workspace the look and feel that suits your organization's brand.

To achieve this, you are required to be the workspace administrator having the [admin](https://github.com/spastorelli/RocketChatDocs/blob/test-datasync-changes/setup-and-administer-rocket.chat/roles-in-rocket.chat) role.

The UI changes can be managed in the Layout \*\*\*\* settings of your workspace. See the guide below for that.

{% content-ref url="../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/layout.md" %}
[layout.md](../../use-rocket.chat/workspace-administration/settings/layout.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
