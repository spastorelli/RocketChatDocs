### Use Name Attribute

The Poll Plus App provides you with an option to display the voter identity as either the full name or the username of the voter.

### Timezone

Since Rocket.Chat is used globally, everyone may not be comfortable with Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The Poll Plus App allows you to choose which timezone to display the poll finish time. The default value for this setting is the UTC timezone.

### Word Cloud API

The word cloud feature uses an API link to fetch word clouds from. The free version of [Quickchart word cloud API](http://quickchart.io/documentation/word-cloud-api/) can be used for small servers . Moreover, it is also the default value for this setting. Quickchart comes with the following restrictions:

* Requires Internet access.
* Enforces rate-limiting of 60 requests per minute per IP.

In the case, you are hosting your own Rocket.Chat **on-premise** or need **more customization** than Quickchart, we've open-sourced an [internal developed word cloud API](https://github.com/RonLek/wordcloud-api). It comes with the following features:

* No Internet access is required.
* No rate-limiting.
* It is free.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the **Wordcloud API endpoin**t is blank and **Word Cloud** is enabled on the poll, the poll summary is displayed when the poll is finished.
{% endhint %}

## Template Based Poll

The Poll Plus App provides some pre-filled template polls. These are some of the most commonly used polls, and pre-filling them saves you from manually typing all the options.

#### 1-to-5 Poll

#### 1-to-10 Poll
